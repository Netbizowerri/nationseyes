    title: '“Resign Now, Stop Destabilizing Our Party” — APC National Secretary Tackles Wike',
    excerpt: 'Senator Ajibola Basiru issues a blistering warning to FCT Minister Nyesom Wike, accusing him of actively destabilizing the ruling party while enjoying its privileges.',
    content: `The internal contradictions of Nigeria’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) burst into the open on Monday as the party’s National Secretary, Senator Ajibola Basiru, issued a blistering warning to the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, accusing him of actively destabilizing the ruling party while enjoying the privileges of its government.

Basiru’s message was blunt and unmistakable: if Wike cannot respect party structures and stop meddling in APC affairs from the outside, he should resign his ministerial position.

Speaking against the backdrop of rising tension within the APC, the National Secretary described Wike’s political conduct as incompatible with party discipline, stressing that the ruling party would not tolerate a situation where a senior government official—who is not a registered member of the APC—exerts undue influence on its internal politics.

> “You cannot be serving in an APC-led government and at the same time act in ways that undermine the party’s cohesion and stability,” Basiru warned. “If he cannot stop interfering, the honourable thing to do is to resign.”

A Minister Without Party Loyalty
Wike’s continued presence in President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s cabinet has remained one of the most controversial political arrangements of the current administration. A card-carrying member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Wike has simultaneously positioned himself as a power broker within APC-dominated political spaces—particularly in Rivers State—fueling accusations of double-dealing and political opportunism.

While the Tinubu administration has often defended Wike’s appointment as a gesture of national unity and bipartisan governance, critics within the APC increasingly see it as a dangerous precedent—one that blurs party identity and emboldens internal sabotage.

Basiru’s intervention signals growing discomfort within the party’s national leadership, many of whom believe Wike’s actions have crossed the line from political cooperation into outright interference.

Rivers Crisis and APC Unease
Much of the tension stems from Wike’s alleged involvement in Rivers State political realignments, where his influence has reportedly complicated APC efforts to consolidate its base and assert clear leadership.

For party loyalists, the optics are troubling: a non-member wielding enormous influence, dictating political outcomes, while genuine APC stakeholders are sidelined.

“This is not about personality; it is about principle,” an APC insider told The Nation’s Eyes. “No party can survive if its internal affairs are manipulated by those who do not belong to it.”

Tinubu’s Balancing Act Under Pressure
Basiru’s statement places renewed pressure on President Tinubu, whose political pragmatism has so far shielded Wike from direct confrontation. However, as intra-party dissent grows louder, the cost of maintaining that balance may soon outweigh its benefits.

At stake is not just party unity, but the moral authority of the APC to demand loyalty, discipline, and ideological coherence from its members.

As 2027 approaches, the ruling party faces a critical question: Can it afford powerful outsiders who play by their own rules, or must loyalty once again become the currency of power?

Editor’s Note
This confrontation exposes the deep contradictions within Nigeria’s ruling party—where political convenience has been allowed to override party ideology and discipline. Senator Basiru’s warning may mark the beginning of a necessary reckoning within the APC, one that forces the party to decide whether it stands for structure or expediency.

    title: 'Prominent Personalities Pay Last Respects at Burial of Dr. Ekechi’s Mother',
    excerpt: 'The burial ceremony of the late matriarch brought together notable figures from the engineering, traditional, and legal communities in a powerful moment of unity.',
    content: `The burial ceremony of the late mother of Dr. Ekechi brought together notable figures from the engineering profession, traditional institution, and the legal community, underscoring the depth of respect the deceased commanded in life and in death.

Among those present was Engr. Uzoma Chigbu, who was seen in solemn company with His Royal Majesty, Eze Fred Nwachukwu, and renowned legal practitioner Barrister Ngozi Olehi, SAN, as they joined family members, friends, and well-wishers to pay their final respects.

The ceremony, marked by dignity and quiet reflection, served not only as a farewell to a matriarch but also as a reminder of the enduring bonds between community leadership, professional excellence, and shared humanity. Attendees described the late matron as a woman whose life was defined by sacrifice, strength, and unwavering support for her family and community.

Speaking through their presence rather than public speeches, the trio’s attendance reflected the cultural importance of standing with one another in moments of grief — a value deeply rooted in Igbo tradition and increasingly rare in modern public life.

Traditional rites were observed in full, blending cultural solemnity with Christian thanksgiving, as prayers were offered for the peaceful repose of the departed and comfort for the bereaved family. The event concluded with tributes celebrating a life well lived and a legacy that will endure through generations.

In a society often fractured by politics and personal ambition, the burial stood out as a quiet yet powerful moment of unity, respect, and shared mourning — a reminder that beyond titles and status, humanity remains our common ground.

Editor’s Note
In moments of loss, the presence of leaders — whether traditional, professional, or legal — speaks louder than words. It is in these silent acts of solidarity that the true strength of community is revealed.

    title: '2027: Kwankwaso Opens Door to Vice Presidential Deal With Peter Obi, Signals Readiness for Alliance',
    excerpt: 'Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has declared his readiness to enter a political alliance for 2027, potentially including a vice-presidential ticket with Peter Obi.',
    content: `Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, national leader of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and former Kano State governor, has declared his readiness to enter a political alliance ahead of the 2027 general elections — including the possibility of accepting a vice-presidential ticket, should the terms align with his political standing and influence.

Kwankwaso made this position known while addressing supporters, stressing that he is open to negotiations that would see him contest either as president or vice president in 2027. Though he stopped short of formally announcing an alliance with Labour Party’s Peter Obi, his remarks have reignited intense speculation about a possible Obi–Kwankwaso ticket, one that many analysts believe could significantly alter Nigeria’s political landscape.

“I am ready for alliances,” Kwankwaso said, according to reports. “But any arrangement must recognize our strength and contribution. It must be either the presidential or vice-presidential ticket.”

A CALCULATED POLITICAL SIGNAL
Kwankwaso’s statement is widely interpreted as a strategic message rather than a binding declaration. It signals flexibility without surrendering leverage — a move consistent with high-stakes coalition politics as opposition figures weigh how best to challenge the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2027.

Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s 2023 presidential candidate, has consistently maintained that he intends to run for president again, not as a running mate. However, Nigerian politics is famously fluid, and history shows that pre-election positions often evolve under pressure of numbers, regions, and funding.

What is clear is that Kwankwaso is positioning himself as too politically significant to be sidelined, especially given his strong grassroots base in Kano and parts of the North-West.

OBSTACLES AND REACTIONS
Not all reactions to the idea of Obi accepting a vice-presidential slot have been favorable. Some of Obi’s supporters and allies argue that stepping down to VP would dilute the momentum built around his 2023 candidacy. Prominent voices within the opposition camp have warned that such a move could fracture support rather than consolidate it.

Yet others counter that politics is about winning, not symbolism, and that a well-structured alliance could end years of ruling-party dominance.

What This Means for 2027
Kwankwaso’s declaration underscores one central reality: 2027 will not be business as usual. Opposition leaders are no longer speaking in absolutes but in possibilities. The era of lone-wolf presidential ambitions may be giving way to hard-nosed negotiations and power-sharing talks.

Whether Peter Obi and Rabiu Kwankwaso eventually meet on the same ticket — and in what order — remains uncertain. But one thing is clear: the conversation has begun, and Nigeria’s political chessboard is already in motion.

Editor’s Note
This development reflects a growing realization among opposition figures that defeating an entrenched ruling structure may require compromise, coalition, and strategic humility. As 2027 approaches, Nigerians should expect more political repositioning — and fewer rigid declarations.

    title: 'Wike’s Political Double-Speak: One Man, Two Parties, No Conviction',
    excerpt: 'FCT Minister Nyesom Wike\'s latest public appearance with both APC and PDP chairmen serves as a loud visual summary of inconsistency and ideological emptiness in modern Nigerian politics.',
    content: `FCT Minister, Nyesom Wike, was on Monday morning spotted in the company of two political figures who, under normal democratic logic, should never occupy the same political space comfortably — Rivers State APC Chairman, Chief Tony Okocha, and Rivers PDP Chairman, Hon. Chukwuemeka Aaron.

The image, now widely circulated, is not just another political photo-op. It is a loud visual summary of everything Nigerians have come to associate with Wike’s politics: inconsistency, ideological emptiness, and transactional alliances.

Once a self-styled PDP warlord who publicly mocked the APC as incompetent and directionless, Wike now sits comfortably with APC power brokers — while still clinging to PDP structures at home. He is neither fully APC nor genuinely PDP. Instead, he has perfected a third political identity: Wikeism — loyalty only to power, not party.

A MINISTER WITHOUT A PARTY — BUT WITH POWER
Wike currently serves as a minister under an APC government, appointed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Yet he has refused to formally defect from the PDP. Instead, he operates a strange dual arrangement: enjoying APC federal power while weakening the PDP from within.

This is not political strategy; it is political sabotage disguised as relevance.

In Rivers State, Wike’s hand is visible in the internal chaos rocking both parties. The PDP is fractured, leadership legitimacy is contested, and the party has been hollowed out from the inside. At the same time, the APC — instead of presenting itself as a disciplined opposition or alternative — has become a willing partner in Wike’s personal power chessboard.

The presence of both party chairmen around one man tells Nigerians a disturbing truth: parties have become tools, not platforms.

WHERE ARE THE IDEALS?
Politics, at its core, is meant to be driven by ideology, policy direction, and loyalty to shared principles. Wike’s political journey offers none of these. His alliances shift not with national interest, but with access to influence, immunity, and control.

Yesterday he was PDP’s loudest enforcer.
Today he is APC’s most useful outsider.
Tomorrow? Whichever side guarantees relevance.

This pattern raises a dangerous question for Nigeria’s democracy: If party lines mean nothing, what exactly are Nigerians voting for?

RIVERS STATE AS COLLATERAL DAMAGE
The biggest casualty of Wike’s political duplicity is Rivers State. Governance has been reduced to factional battles, godfather supremacy, and endless power tussles. Institutions are weakened, political loyalty is monetized, and the electorate is treated as an afterthought.

When one man can comfortably preside over the ruins of two parties without accountability, democracy itself is in trouble.

FINAL THOUGHT
Wike’s politics may be effective for personal survival, but it is corrosive to democratic culture. A system where one individual can play APC and PDP simultaneously is a system without ideological backbone.

Nigeria deserves politicians who stand for something, not men who stand everywhere.

Editor’s Note
This development is not about a photograph; it is about what the photograph represents — the collapse of ideological politics and the rise of power without principles in Nigeria’s democratic space.

    title: 'HOPE UZODIMMA SHOCKS NYESOM WIKE: APC GOVERNORS RALLY BEHIND FUBARA AS FCT MINISTER’S POWER PLAY BACKFIRES',
    excerpt: 'In a dramatic twist, a bloc of influential APC governors led by Hope Uzodimma has thrown its full weight behind Governor Fubara, signaling a major rebuff of Wike’s influence.',
    content: `In a dramatic twist within Nigeria’s high-stakes political arena, the calculated moves by the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, to frustrate the 2027 re-election prospects of Rivers State Governor Siminalayi Fubara have reportedly collapsed—triggering an unexpected backlash from within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) itself.

Multiple sources within the APC confirm that a bloc of influential governors, led by Imo State Governor and APC National Chairman, Hope Uzodimma, has thrown its full political weight behind Governor Fubara—an endorsement that amounts to a direct and public rebuff of Wike’s aggressive political posture.

What was intended as a strategic isolation of Fubara has now morphed into a dangerous exposure of Wike’s waning influence.

APC Leadership Draws the Line
According to party insiders, APC’s national leadership has not only distanced itself from Wike’s campaign against Fubara but has also commended the Rivers governor’s developmental strides, quietly signaling that the party sees Fubara as a stabilizing figure rather than a political liability.

“This is no longer about Rivers State alone,” one senior APC source disclosed. “It is about drawing a line against political overreach, intimidation, and the weaponization of federal power.”

The Move That Sparked the Revolt
The political crisis reportedly escalated when Wike’s loyalists allegedly attempted to impose former PDP National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, as Imo State governor-in-waiting, without consultation or approval from Hope Uzodimma.

That move, sources say, was perceived as a direct insult and a declaration of war.

Uzodimma—known for his calm but calculated political instincts—was said to be deeply angered by what he viewed as Wike’s attempt to undermine his authority as APC chairman and destabilize Imo State’s political structure.

The response was swift and decisive: Uzodimma reportedly mobilized fellow APC governors, forging a united front aimed at curbing Wike’s expanding influence across party and state lines.

Wike’s Power Play Meets Resistance
For years, Wike has built a reputation as a political enforcer—feared, loud, and unapologetically confrontational. But this latest confrontation appears to have revealed the limits of that strategy.

What is unfolding now is not just a Rivers State dispute, but a broader power realignment within Nigeria’s ruling elite, where governors are increasingly unwilling to tolerate unilateral control by a federal minister—no matter how powerful.

If the current momentum holds, the irony will be unmistakable: In trying to destroy Fubara’s political future, Wike may have inadvertently secured it.

Editor’s Note
This episode exposes a growing resistance within Nigeria’s political class against unchecked power and political intimidation. As 2027 approaches, alliances are shifting, egos are colliding, and influence is being re-negotiated. One lesson is already clear: power is no longer absolute—and those who overplay their hand risk losing everything.

    title: 'Tinubu Raises Professors’ Salaries — But Tax Takes a Heavy Bite',
    excerpt: 'The federal government has announced a gross salary increase for professors, but post-tax figures reveal a surprisingly marginal gain for Nigeria’s top academics.',
    content: `President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s administration has announced an upward review of professors’ salaries in federal universities, raising the monthly gross pay from ₦711,120 to ₦995,568.

However, new figures released by Professor Amoka of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, reveal that the increase may be far less impactful than it appears on paper.

According to Professor Amoka, who disclosed the details while responding to Daily Trust, a total of ₦243,914 will be deducted as tax, leaving professors with a net monthly take-home pay of ₦751,655.

A RAISE THAT SHRINKS AFTER DEDUCTIONS
While the government has presented the salary adjustment as a major intervention to address the long-standing grievances of academic staff, the post-tax reality tells a more sobering story.

In effect, professors — Nigeria’s highest-ranking academics — will take home just ₦40,535 more than their previous gross salary, once taxes are removed. For many lecturers, this marginal increase is being rapidly eroded by inflation, rising food prices, transport costs, electricity tariffs, and housing expenses.

INFLATION VS INCREMENT
Nigeria’s inflation rate remains stubbornly high, with food inflation hitting ordinary households and professionals alike. Critics argue that without a corresponding tax relief framework or cost-of-living adjustment, salary increments risk becoming symbolic rather than transformational.

“An increase that disappears before it reaches your pocket is not economic relief,” one senior lecturer told The Nation’s Eyes anonymously. “It is accounting gymnastics.”

ASUU’S LINGERING CONCERNS
The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has consistently argued that salary reviews alone cannot fix Nigeria’s collapsing education system. Issues such as earned academic allowances, university funding, research grants, and brain drain remain unresolved.

With Nigerian professors increasingly migrating to universities in Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, and the Middle East, observers say the new figures may do little to stem the exodus.

OPTICS VS REALITY
While the Tinubu administration may point to the salary review as proof of commitment to education reform, analysts warn that optics without structural relief could further deepen distrust between the government and the academic community.

As Professor Amoka’s figures demonstrate, the real question is no longer how much is announced, but how much actually reaches the lecturer’s pocket.

Editor’s Note
Salary increases mean little if inflation and taxation quietly confiscate the gains. Without holistic reforms — including tax relief, stable funding, and improved working conditions — Nigeria risks continuing the slow death of its university system while celebrating paper victories.
